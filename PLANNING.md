related to the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

2. Affirmation (type the word 'DONE') that ticker selection is completed.
3. Answer 'Y' or 'N' to indicate the date range or specific date choice.
4. Type requisite dates in YYYY/MM/DD format.

**Information Outputs**

range or specific date specified.
2. In the case of a date range, cumulative returns over the specified range will
be calculated and returned to the user for each ticker he/she selected as well as
for the Dow Jones.
3. The displayed application output will be written to a csv file.
